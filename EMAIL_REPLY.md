Subject: Re: Full Stack Engineer Position - Assignment Submission

Hi Bhargavi,

Thank you for the opportunity.

I have completed the UI-focused coding assignment and have hosted it as requested.

**GitHub Repository Link:**
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/github-profile-app

**Deployment Details:**

- **Live Preview:** https://ujjwal-github-profile.netlify.app/user/shreeramk
- **Hosting Platform:** Netlify
- **Build Status:** Successfully deployed and accessible

The application is fully functional and ready for review. You can view any GitHub user's profile by replacing the username in the URL (e.g., `/user/shreeramk` → `/user/any-username`).

Please let me know if you need any additional information or have any questions.

Best regards,
Ujjwal Mishra
